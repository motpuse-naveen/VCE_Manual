    <p>Low engine rpm should be maintained in all handling for optimal use of the system and minimal fuel consumption. Exceptions are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>when filling the bucket, when engine rpm should be adapted to the material's resistance.</li>
        <li>during the acceleration phase in longer work cycles, e.g., load-carry. When transport speed is reached, ease off on the throttle.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Lift speed and power are sufficient already at low engine speed, which gives lower fuel consumption, lower sound level, and higher comfort with maintained high productivity.</b></p>
