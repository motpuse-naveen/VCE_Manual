    <p>When working in a particularly dusty environment, we recommend the use of a pre-cleaner.</p>
    <p>The pre-cleaner is installed on the air intake instead of the rain cap.</p>

    <p>In operating conditions with a high generation of dust we recommend the oil bath pre-cleaner.</p>
    <p>The high particle-retaining ability of the oil bath pre- cleaner usually extends the replacement interval to approx. twice as long.</p>
    <p><b>Check the oil level daily. <br>The total oil capacity is 2,5 litres (0.66 US gal).</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change oil and clean lower and upper steel mesh filter if:
            <ul>
                <li>the oil is dirty and viscous.</li>
                <li>there is sludge deposits or dry spots on the underside of the lower steel mesh filter.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The oil bowl, the lower and upper steel mesh filters should be washed in diesel fuel.</li>
        <li>Avoid using petrol (gasoline) for cleaning, as any remaining petrol can cause the engine to surge when it is started later.</li>
        <li>When filling or changing oil use oil with the same viscosity as in the engine.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Clean the steel mesh filter inserts inserts every 2000 hours.</b></p>
    <p><b>Take care of care of filters/oils/liquids in an environmentally safe way, see page 206.</b></p>
