    <h3 class="manual-heading-l3">Exhaust aftertreatment system</h3>
    <p>The engine features an exhaust after treatment system (EATS) in the form of two mufflers. The first one contains a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) and a diesel particulate filter (DPF) to reduce emissions of particulate matter (PM). The second one contains a selective catalytic reduction catalyst (SCR) to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.</p>
    <p>The SCR uses diesel exhaust fluid, called AdBlue®or diesel exhaust fluid (DEF), to reduce the NOx emissions. An AdBlue®/DEF injection system is used to add this fluid to the exhaust.</p>
    <p>During the regeneration process the exhaust temperature may increase also at the outlet of the end-pipe. Due to the increased temperature, the regeneration process is not automatic but it is started manually. The operator receives an indication via the machine's information display unit when the filter needs a regeneration.</p>
