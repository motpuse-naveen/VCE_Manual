                        The exhaust control systems for your new Volvo Construction Equipment engine have been designed, manufactured, and tested using genuine parts, and they have been certified according to American federal and California regulations on exhaust control. According to these all spare parts that are to be used for maintenance, repairs, or replacement of exhaust control systems shall be parts from Volvo Construction Equipment. The owner may let any workshop or mechanic perform maintenance, replacement, or repair of exhaust control components and systems that have been certified by the US Environmental Protection Agency. The owner may choose to use other parts than genuine Volvo Construction Equipment parts for such maintenance, replacement, or repair without the warranty becoming invalid, but the warranty does not cover the cost of such services or parts.
